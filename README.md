# Event-Management-Application

## Description
Welcome to our Event Management Application! This app is designed to help you manage all your events, whether they're big conferences or casual get-togethers. With a sleek frontend built using React, a robust backend powered by Express, and MongoDB handling our data, you're in good hands.

## How to Run

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Naveen-g09/Event-Managment-WEBAPP.git
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and install the necessary dependencies. Run the following commands:

```bash
cd Event-Managment-WEBAPP
npm install
```

This will install the required modules for the frontend.

### Step 3: Set Up Backend
Navigate to the server folder within the project directory and install backend dependencies:

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

### Step 4: Configuration
Replace the environment files with your own credentials in both the frontend and backend folders. This will ensure proper connection to your database and other services.

### Step 5: Run the Application
Now, let's fire up both the frontend and backend. Open two separate terminals, navigate to the project directory in each terminal, and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start both the frontend and backend servers concurrently.

### Step 6: Explore and Enjoy
With both the frontend and backend up and running, open your browser and head to the designated address. You can now sign up, log in, create events, browse existing ones, and even register for events. Try different actions, like registering as another user from a different browser, to fully experience the app's capabilities.

### Step 7: Dive into the Data
After exploring the app, you can peek into the database to see how your actions have affected the data. This step will give you insight into how the app manages and stores information.

And that's it! You're all set to dive into event management with our application. If you have any questions or run into any issues, don't hesitate to reach out to us. Happy event planning! ðŸŽ‰
